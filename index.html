            <h2 class="list-header">Choux Pastry</h2>
            <ul class="choux-pastry-instructions">
                <li id="li1"> Combine ½ cup butter, ½ cup water, ½ cup whole milk, ¼ tsp salt, and 2 tsp granulated sugar together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the butter has melted. Bring mixture to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Once simmering, reduce heat to low and add 1 cup flour all at once. Stir until the flour is completely incorporated. Gently cook the dough in the pan for 1 minute. Remove from heat and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Allow to cool down for a few minutes before adding the eggs in the next step.</li>
                <li>With a handheld mixer running on low speed, slowly add 4 eggs in 3-4 separate additions mixing for 30 seconds between each.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs until the choux pastry has reached the desired texture: shiny, thick, and smooth with a pipeable consistency. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and lightly brush with water.</li>
                <li>Using a round-tip piping bag, pipe 4-inch logs 3 inches apart. Using a water moistened finger, smooth down any peaks or ends, then lightly brush each log with egg wash (1 egg + 3 tbsp water).</li>
                <li>Bake for 20 minutes then, keeping the pastries in the oven, reduce the oven to 350°F (177°C) and continue to bake for 10-15 more minutes until golden brown. Do not open the oven as the pastries cook, as cool air will prevent them from properly puffing up. Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely before filling</li>

            <h2 class="list-header">Peanut Butter Mousse</h2>
            <ul class="pb-mousse-instructions">
                <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat 1 cup heavy cream on medium-high speed until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Temporarily transfer to another mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Using the same mixer attachment, beat 8oz full-fat cream cheese on medium-high speed until creamy and smooth</li>
                <li>Add 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and ½ cup peanut butter then beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy.</li>
                <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in the whipped cream until combined.</li>
                <li>Taste. Stir in a pinch of salt, if desired.</li>
                <li>Poke a hole on both sides of each eclair with a toothpick. Transfer mousse to a piping bag fitted with a small-ish round or open star piping tip. Pipe mousse into the pastry until it slightly overflows each end.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate while you make the Chocolate Ganache.</li>

            <h2 class="list-header">Chocolate Ganache</h2>
            <ul class="chocolate-ganache-instructions">
                <li>Place 8oz finely chopped semi-sweet chocolate in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 cup heavy cream in a small saucepan until it begins to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil—that is too hot!)</li>
                <li>Pour over chocolate and let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften the chocolate.</li>
                <li>Slowly stir until completely combined and chocolate has melted.</li>
                <li>Dip the top of each eclair into chocolate ganache and place on a serving plate or cooling rack until ready to serve.</li>
                <li>Chocolate ganache topping sets in about an hour at room temperature or in about 30 minutes in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li>Serve chilled or room temperature and ENJOY!</li>
